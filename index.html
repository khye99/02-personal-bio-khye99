          <h1>      <font color = "29105D">About me:</font>        </h1>
                <font color = "29105D">I am a current undergraduate first year student at <em> Washington University in St. Louis</em>.
                      I love to travel, experience new cultures, and capture all those special moments with my camera. I also love to dance.
                      I have been dancing since I was 5. I'm a part of the Lunar New Year Festival organization here on campus, and we're
                      having our annual showcase on February 2nd and 3rd. Tickets are on sale for $10! Come out and support us and you
                      can watch me dance! I also love music, whether it's playing classical on instruments or jamming out to hip-hop.
                      Doing community service and helping those in need is also something I feel really proud doing. Fun fact: I broke my
                      arm in 3rd grade from falling off the couch. You never think some things are possible until they happen. I'm also an ardent
                      dog lover, but cats are great too! A fun goal of mine for the future is to be able to make generous donations to all those people
                      on the internet who have taken the time to make educational videos to help students like myself get through school, and
                      all at the cost of nothing. These people are my heros. It would also be really cool if one day I could develop some awesome
                      app or software that everyone will love.</font>
